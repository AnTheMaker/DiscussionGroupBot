# DiscussionGroupBot
A Telegram Bot that automatically removes all forwarded posts from your linked channel so the group doesn't get filled with channel posts!

## Setup
1. Install PHP-CLI. (probably it needs also curl library)
2. Rename config_sample.json to config.json and edit the Bot Token and your user_id.
3. Give bot.php run priviledges and run the script.
4. Enjoy!
